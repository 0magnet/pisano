// The turtle in three dimensions.
//
// In the plane the heading lives in Z/4 and one pass of the period is a rigid
// motion: turn through some whole number of right angles, then translate. That
// is what lets Classify decide closure without walking. In space the heading
// lives in the rotation group of the cube — order 24 — and one pass is still a
// rigid motion, so the same argument works and says more.
//
// Iterating a rigid motion (R, t) k times displaces by
//
//	S = (I + R + … + R^{k-1}) t
//
// and taking k to be the order of R makes that sum k times the projection of t
// onto R's fixed space. So the path closes exactly when the drift has no
// component along the axis of rotation. That reduces correctly: in the plane a
// non-trivial rotation fixes only the origin, the sum always vanishes, and
// every turning path closes — which is the two-dimensional theorem.
//
// Space adds an outcome the plane cannot have. When there is a net turn AND an
// axial drift, iterating is a screw motion: the figure winds along its own axis
// forever. It also adds a period: element orders in Z/4 are 1, 2 and 4, but in
// the rotation group of the cube they are 1, 2, 3 and 4, so a path can close
// after exactly three passes — from a rotation about a body diagonal.
//
// The rule
//
// A term still turns the turtle and steps it forward one unit, and a zero term
// still does neither. What is new is which way the turn goes: the parity of the
// term picks left or right, as in the plane, and the parity of the NEXT term
// picks whether the turn is a yaw or a pitch.
//
// Reading the pair rather than a second bit of one term is not arbitrary. The
// pair (F_n, F_{n+1}) mod m is the state of the recurrence, and the Pisano
// period is precisely the period of that pair — it is why the period is the
// length it is. Driving the third dimension from the pair keeps the figure a
// picture of the thing the arithmetic is about.
//
// A variant taking both bits from the one term was measured against this and
// lost on every count: it cannot use the third dimension at all when the
// modulus is 2 (a residue has no second bit there) and under-uses it for small
// moduli generally; its helices wind about the initial "up" axis far more than
// anything else, which is the starting frame leaking into the figure; and its
// figures come out flatter. Over the Fibonacci moduli to 3000 this rule turns
// out of plane on 51–58% of moves whatever the modulus, against 38–45% and
// falling for the other.
